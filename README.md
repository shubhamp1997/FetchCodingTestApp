# Fetch Rewards Coding Exercise Android App
This android application project is a submission to Fetch Rewards.
The link for the same is here:[Coding Challenge Link](https://fetch-hiring.s3.amazonaws.com/mobile.html).

## Tasks performed:
1. In this Application we Fetch data from a JSON file from the URL: https://fetch-hiring.s3.amazonaws.com/hiring.json
2. Group the Items into specific lists based on their listId.
3. Sort the Items by their ID/ Item Number
4. Remove the Items with null or ""(blank) values.
5. Upload the project on a public git repository.

#### To Complete the tasks I have created a Native Java Android Application running on Android Marshmallow+

## Setup:
1. To run the application on your android device directly, download and install this .apk file: [Download apk](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-egDtKdovTO8nJ9imTpbtQde5VjXOhyn/view?usp=sharing).
2. Alternatively, you can also clone this repository and run the application on your device or emulator.

## Screed recroding of the working of the app:

In the above Video we can see that initially there is no data untill we fetch it, after tapping on Fetch Data button, we can see the loading Dialog which finishes in some time giving users some assurance that the task is running and shortly after that, we can see our data, fetched, parsed, cleaned, sorted, grouped on one page.
We can also see, that to see the data/items in theri respectable lists we can just tap on a button which will group the data and leave the rest of it.
